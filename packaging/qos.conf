# Enable ClearOS Bandwidth QoS Engine

# External interface speeds in kbit/s.
#
# Format:
#  <ifn>:<speed>:<r2q>[ <ifn>:<speed>:<r2q>] ...
#
# Where <ifn> is the name of the external interface.
# Where <speed> is the external connection speed in kbit/s.
# Where <r2q> is the used to calculate the queue quantum (see below).
#   You may set this to 'auto' (no quotes) to have an r2q value
#   calculated for you.
#
# NOTE:
#
#  - Specify multiple external interfaces using a space delimiter.
#
#  - The accuracy of the speed values is critital for correct operation
#    of the QoS rules.  Too low and the connection(s) will be throttled.
#    Too high and the QoS engine will become unpredictable.
#
#  - The 'r2q' parameter stands for 'rate to quantum' and is the
#    conversion factor used to calculate the quantum value for a queue.
#    The quantum is calculated using the formula:
#
#    quantum = rate (in bytes) / r2q
#
#    The resulting quantum should be greater than your interface MTU and
#    less than 60,000 (though it appears the value hard-coded in the
#    kernal is 200,000 for 3.7.x).
#
#    If you see kernel messages such as:
#    "HTB: quantum of class 10002 is small/large. Consider r2q change."
#    You should calculate a better r2q value.
#    
# Example:
#  QOS_UPSTREAM="ppp0:7168:auto"
#  QOS_DOWNSTREAM="ppp0:25600:10"
